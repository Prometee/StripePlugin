# UPGRADE FROM 1.0.x to 1.1

## Gateway configuration

### `payment_method_types` is deprecated

Configuring `payment_method_types` in the Stripe gateway configuration (Sylius admin → Payment methods → 
Stripe (Checkout) / Stripe (Web Elements)) is deprecated and will be removed in 2.0.

When the field is non-empty, the plugin sends a static `payment_method_types` array to Stripe at PaymentIntent / Checkout 
Session creation, which overrides Stripe's automatic payment methods and prevents the Stripe Dashboard from controlling 
which methods are displayed to customers.

**Migration:**

1. Open your Stripe Dashboard → Settings → Payment methods and enable the methods you want to offer.
2. In Sylius admin, edit your Stripe payment method and clear all entries from the "Payment method types" field.
3. Save. Stripe will now dynamically present the most relevant subset of the configured methods based on the customer's 
   country, currency and transaction amount.

Existing installations that keep the field populated will continue to work in 1.1 with the legacy behaviour, 
but a deprecation notice will be triggered on every payment request. In 2.0 the field, the runtime provider 
and the related admin form section will be removed.

**For developers extending the plugin**, the following will be removed in Stripe Plugin 2.0:

- Class `FluxSE\SyliusStripePlugin\Provider\PaymentMethodTypesProvider`
- Service `flux_se.sylius_stripe.provider.checkout.create.payment_method_types`
- Service `flux_se.sylius_stripe.provider.web_elements.create.payment_method_types`

If your custom code references the class or either service (e.g. via DI decoration, alias or direct injection), 
remove those references before upgrading to 2.0.

### `secret_key` set to a standard Stripe secret key (`sk_*`) is deprecated

Pasting a standard Stripe secret key (`sk_test_…` / `sk_live_…`) into the `Restricted API key (recommended) or secret key` 
field of the Stripe gateway configuration is deprecated since 1.1 and will be removed in 2.0. From 2.0 onwards, only
Restricted API Keys (`rk_test_…` / `rk_live_…`) will be accepted.

A deprecation notice is triggered on every Stripe API client build for payment methods that still hold a `sk_*` key. 
Existing installations continue to work in 1.1, the field validator and the runtime path are unchanged.

**Migration:**

1. Install the [Sylius Stripe App][link-sylius-stripe-app] on your Stripe account.
2. Open the App's Settings Page and copy the generated Restricted API Key (`rk_test_…` / `rk_live_…`).
3. In Sylius admin, edit your Stripe payment method and paste the `rk_*` key into the `Restricted API key (recommended) or secret key` 
   field, replacing the previous `sk_*` value. Save.

The App ships with the minimum scopes the plugin needs, which is also why it becomes the only supported source for 
the `secret_key` field in 2.0.
